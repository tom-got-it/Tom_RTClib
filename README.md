# Despription
This is a fort of the adafruit RTCLib repository.
It extends the support for the DS3231 by additional features:
* check whether interrupts (SQW-out) for alarm 1 are active
* check whether interrupts (SQW-out) for alarm 2 are active
* write and read to RAM (there is a small amount of 32 Bit of RAM available that can be used)
